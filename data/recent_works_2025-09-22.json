This shortage increases the risk of significant negative impacts on livestock management, agriculture, and public health in rural and remote communities. To provide concrete solutions to sustain our rural veterinarian workforce, we examine motivations, incentives, and deterrents to rural veterinary practice (RVP). We do this through a qualitative study in Alberta, Canada, which is a geographically unique and understudied context. Methods We surveyed veterinary students and practicing veterinarians, obtaining 124 responses. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Results revealed key motivating factors that influence attraction and retention included personal and family considerations that require living in rural contexts, the nature of strong relationships that develop in rural communities, experiencing a range in work factors that enhances professional development, feeling fulfilled by rural veterinary work, and exposure during veterinary school leading to a strong interest in rural settings. Deterrents included limited resources and supports in rural contexts, personal and family needs that require living in urban settings, and challenges inherent to rural communities and environmental characteristics. Finally, key incentives included better salary and benefits, financial incentives, tuition/debt forgiveness, enhanced mentorship, fewer on-call duties, and tailored incentives. Discussion Strong alignment between student and practicing veterinarian motivations, deterrents, and incentives was observed, extending previous findings that only look at the perceptions of a single group. The results corroborated previous findings, while revealing that the same motivations and deterrents remained important for students and PVs in Alberta’s geographically unique context. Finally, they provided key insights to inform policy, practice, and education developments to enhance attraction and retention rates of rural veterinarians, contributing to a path forward for addressing the rural shortage of veterinary services.",

Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, crossover study. Setting Experimental. Animals Twenty‐nine healthy research‐purposed cats. Interventions The VD group received 2 mg/kg furosemide IV every 30–60 min over 6 h, followed by 10 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid or tetrastarch given over 10 min. The IVVO group did not receive furosemide and was administered 30 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid over 10 min. Ultrasonographic images of the CVC (subxiphoid view) and heart (right parasternal short‐axis view) were recorded and subjectively evaluated by an operator in real time from both groups at baseline (T0), after furosemide/6 h (T1), and after fluids (T2). CVC inspiratory (CVC insp ) and expiratory (CVC exp ) diameters, CVC collapsibility index (CVC CI ), left atrium‐to‐aorta ratio (LA:Ao), and left ventricular internal diameter in systole (LVIDs) and diastole (LVIDd) were measured and subjectively graded post hoc by two blinded raters (different to the operator) for CVC parameters; one blinded rater evaluated FCU parameters. Measurements and Main Results In the VD group, CVC insp ( p = 0.004), CVC exp ( p = 0.008), LVIDs ( p &lt; 0.001), and LVIDd ( p &lt; 0.001) were smaller after administration of furosemide. In the IVVO group, CVC insp ( p = 0.02), CVC exp ( p = 0.04), LVIDs ( p &lt; 0.001), and LVIDd ( p = 0.001) were larger after fluid administration. The LA:Ao ratio was not different in any group at any time. Intrarater and interrater reliability were moderate to poor. Subjective CVC and FCU assessments were consistent with objective measurements. Conclusions Experimentally induced VD and volume overload result in sonographically detectable changes in the CVC insp and CVC exp diameters and LVIDs and LVIDd of cats, suggesting the assessment of these parameters may have value in the clinical setting.",

      "abstract_text": "We investigated the prevalence, cyst density, and any associated pathologic changes of Besnoitia spp. in the testis, peritesticular structures, and udder skin of migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Possible risk factors for infection, cyst density, and inflammation were investigated. Samples from 149 male and 229 female caribou were collected from seven different herds across Canada, Alaska (US), and Greenland, 2007-09. Biopsies were taken from the udder skin in females and from the epididymis, scrotal skin, testis (seminiferous tubules and tunica albuginea), and spermatic cord in males. The cyst density (cysts per square millimeters) of Besnoitia spp. in each tissue, as well as the type of associated inflammation, were determined by histopathologic examination. Individual (age class) and environmental (season and herd) risk factors were investigated for infection, cyst density, and inflammation. Besnoitia spp. cysts were detected in 22.2, 20.4, 11.2, 31.3, 10.4, and 8.0% of the sections of epididymis, scrotal skin, seminiferous tubules, spermatic cord, tunica albuginea, and udder skin, respectively. The median cyst densities varied from 0.07 cysts/mm2 in the seminiferous tubules to 1.02 cysts/mm2 in the udder skin. Age class and season were risk factors for infection, so adults and subadults were more at risk than calves, and infection was more prevalent in the fall months (September to December) relative to other seasons. Subadults, however, demonstrated a higher cyst density compared with adults and calves. During the winter months, a higher risk of inflammation was present compared with other seasons. Overall, the intensity of inflammation was light to mild, and both pericystic and concomitant inflammation were commonly present. Further research should determine whether these parasitic cysts and the associated inflammation influence the functionality of the testis, peritesticular structures, and udder and thus reproduction.",
