      <h2>Automated weekly summary</h2>
      <div style="white-space:pre-wrap;line-height:1.4">Here are the six new works published in the 2025-08-07 to 2025-08-21 window, with journals, full cohort author names, and concise notable findings.

- Use of 2 sedation protocols to successfully validate a sedation assessment scale in bearded dragons (bearded dragons) ∶ American Journal of Veterinary Research ∶ 2025-08-19 ∶ Daniel Pang ∶ Demonstrates successful validation of a sedation assessment scale using two protocols (dexmedetomidine + methadone; and dexmedetomidine + methadone + ketamine) in a randomized, blinded crossover study with 10 subjects; supports cross-species behavior-based sedation assessment. Cohort authors: Daniel Pang.

- Influenza infection of the mammary gland ∶ Journal of Virology ∶ 2025-08-12 ∶ Alyson A. Kelvin ∶ Examines the role of respiratory viruses in mammary gland infection and the potential for vertical transmission, highlighting the understudied link between viral infections and mammary health. Cohort authors: Alyson A. Kelvin.

- A fitness tracker can be used interchangeably with a reference method for underwater single-lead electrocardiography but not heart rate variability analysis in swimming horses ∶ American Journal of Veterinary Research ∶ 2025-08-12 ∶ Renaud Léguillette ∶ Validates a single-lead ECG fitness tracker against a reference multilead device for heart rate in swimming horses; finds good agreement for HR but not for HR variability measures. Cohort authors: Renaud Léguillette.

- Contrasting roles of autophagy in cellular prion infection ∶ Autophagy ∶ 2025-08-09 ∶ Sabine Gilch; Hermann Schä tzl ∶ Shows cell-type dependent effects of autophagy on prion replication: autophagy competence promotes prion replication in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, while autophagy impairment largely reduces prion propagation in neuronal cells. Cohort authors: Sabine Gilch; Hermann Schätzl.

- Modified Huangqi Shengmai Yin enhances ruminal microbiome and metabolites activity in dairy cows with subclinical mastitis ∶ Frontiers in Veterinary Science ∶ 2025-08-08 ∶ John P. Kastelic ∶ Investigates the therapeutic potential of a modified Huangqi Shengmai Yin formulation (mHSY) on subclinical mastitis, with reported effects on ruminal microbiome and metabolite activity and exploration of underlying mechanisms. Cohort authors: John P. Kastelic.

- Cysteinyl leukotrienes stimulate gut absorption of food allergens to promote anaphylaxis in mice ∶ Science ∶ 2025-08-07 ∶ Mia Madel Alfajaro ∶ Reveals that variance in intestinal allergen transport and anaphylaxis susceptibility is linked to Dpep1 (DPEP1) gene variants; resistant strains show reduced allergen transport, implicating DPEP1 in allergen uptake and severe allergic responses. Cohort authors: Mia Madel Alfajaro.

Methods In a randomized, blinded, crossover study, 10 bearded dragons were sedated IM with dexmedetomidine (0.1 mg/kg) and methadone (2 mg/kg; DM), and dexmedetomidine (0.1 mg/kg), methadone (2 mg/kg), and ketamine (10 mg/kg; DMK). Sedation assessment was performed with video recording at baseline (T0) and every 5 minutes from 10 to 60 minutes after injection (T10 to T60). After T60, atipamezole (1 mg/kg) was given IM. Behaviors used to assess sedation in several species were teste…</div></details></td>

In both humans and animals, the lactating mammary gland is susceptible to bacterial and viral infections, which can lead to mastitis and, in some cases, vertical transmission to offspring, with potential adverse effects on infant health. However, until recently, the role of respiratory viruses in mammary gland infection has been relatively understudied, particularly their ability to infect mammary epithelial ce…</div></details></td>

Methods 40 race-fit Thoroughbred racehorses were used for 5 days in May 2024. Surface ECG recordings were obtained simultaneously from the FT and RM devices in horses swimming 63.65 m across a pool. Electrocardiograms were reviewed and artifacts corrected when necessary, and correlations were analyzed between the 2 devices for HR and HRV parameters. Descriptive statistics…</div></details></td>

We tested the role of macroautophagy/autophagy in prion infection and how this machinery affects the life cycle of prions. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found a pronounced dependence of prion replication on autophagy competence, suggesting that autophagy provides functions needed for prion propagation. However, in neuronal cells, autophagy had mostly the opposite role. Cells ablated for autophagy competence by gene editing harbored elevated amounts of misfo…</div></details></td>
