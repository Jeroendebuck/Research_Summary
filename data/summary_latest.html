Journal of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care, 2025-08-30; Cohort author: Søren Boysen. Two lung ultrasound protocols (modified Calgary PLUS vs VetBLUE) were compared in 64 clinically healthy cats; B-lines were detected in 14–27% and Z-lines in 96.9% regardless of protocol; Calgary PLUS yielded higher total counts of B-/I-/Z-lines and more cats with ≥1 B- or I-line than VetBLUE.

Restoration of locomotor function following stimulation of the A13 region in Parkinson’s mouse models. venue not specified, 2025-08-27; Cohort author: Patrick J. Whelan. Photoactivation of the A13 region improves bradykinesia/akinesia in a PD mouse model; A13 activity correlates with movement speed via projections to the mesencephalic locomotor region; whole-brain imaging shows remodeling of A13 afferent/efferent circuits, positioning the zona incerta as a key motor hub.

Design Prospective cross‐sectional study from June to September 2022. Setting Companion animal referral hospital. Animals Sixty‐four cats determined to be healthy based on history and physical examination. Interventions All cats had point‐of‐care lung ultrasound performed with frequency of B‐, I‐, and Z‐lines recorded. Findings of a modified Calgary pleura and lung ultrasound (PLUS) protocol (19 sites recorded) and a veterinary Brief Lung Ultrasound Exam (VetBLUE) protocol (nine sites), both including the subxiphoid site, were compared. Measurements and Main Results B‐lines were identified in 14%–27% of cats depending on the protocol used, with a median of &amp;lt;3 B‐lines total per cat, &amp;lt;2 B‐lines per hemithorax, and ≤2 positive B‐line sites per hemithorax, regardless of the protocol used. The total number of B‐, I‐, or Z‐lines identified was significantly higher for the modified Calgary PLUS compared with VetBLUE. The number of cats with ≥1 B‐ and I‐lines was significantly higher with modified Calgary PLUS compared with VetBLUE, with 17 (26.6%) and 42 (65.6%) versus nine (14.1%) and 34 (53.1%) cats identified, respectively. Z‐lines were identified in 62 (96.9%) cats regardless of the protocol used. Three (4.7%) cats had ≥1 B‐line at the subxiphoid view. Conclusions B‐lines were detected in &amp;lt;30%, I‐lines in &amp;gt;50%, and Z‐lines in &amp;gt;95% of clinically healthy cats regardless of protocol used. B‐lines were rarely detected at the subxiphoid view. A significant difference between protocols was found when comparing the percentage of cats with B‐ and I‐lines.</div></details></td>

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by extensive motor and non-motor dysfunction, including gait disturbance, which is difficult to treat effectively. This study explores the therapeutic potential of targeting the A13 region, a heterogeneous region of the medial zona incerta (mZI) containing dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons that has shown relative preservation in PD models. The A13 is identified to project to the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), with a subpopulation of cells displaying activity correlating to movement speed, suggesting its role in locomotion. We show that photoactivation of this A13 region can alleviate bradykinesia and akinetic features, while increasing turning in a mouse model of PD. These effects combine disease-specific rescue of function with a possible gain of function. We identified areas of preservation and plasticity within the A13 region using whole-brain imaging. Our findings suggest a global remodeling of afferent and efferent projections of the A13 region, highlighting the zona incerta’s role as a crucial hub for the rapid selection of motor function. The study unveils the significant pro-locomotor effects of the A13 region and suggests its promising potential as a therapeutic target for PD-related gait dysfunction.</div></details></td>
