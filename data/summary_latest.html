- Use of 2 sedation protocols to successfully validate a sedation assessment scale in bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) — American Journal of Veterinary Research, 2025-08-19 — Cohort author: Daniel Pang

  - Study design and scale development: randomized, blinded, crossover with 10 bearded dragons; compared dexmedetomidine–methadone (DM) vs dexmedetomidine–methadone–ketamine (DMK); 6 items selected to form a sedation scale; video-based scoring across multiple timepoints (T0 baseline, T10–T60 post-injection); atipamezole reversal used.
  - Key findings on scale performance: DMK yielded deeper sedation than DM from T10 to T60; intra- and inter-rater reliability for the scale were very good (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.81); internal consistency high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.904); six items validated for the scale.
  - Conclusions and implications: the sedation scale demonstrated validity, responsiveness, and reliability for assessing sedation in bearded dragons; no adverse events reported; data exclusions noted (pilot DM and one misinjection).

Methods In a randomized, blinded, crossover study, 10 bearded dragons were sedated IM with dexmedetomidine (0.1 mg/kg) and methadone (2 mg/kg; DM), and dexmedetomidine (0.1 mg/kg), methadone (2 mg/kg), and ketamine (10 mg/kg; DMK). Sedation assessment was performed with video recording at baseline (T0) and every 5 minutes from 10 to 60 minutes after injection (T10 to T60). After T60, atipamezole (1 mg/kg) was given IM. Behaviors used to assess sedation in several species were tested. Construct validity (ie, does a scale measure what is intended) was evaluated by comparing sedation scores over time using the Friedman and Dunn post hoc tests and between treatments, using a Mann-Whitney test. Scores of 25 videos randomly selected from a total of 216 recorded videos were used to calculate intra- and inter-rater reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Internal consistency was calculated using the Cronbach α coefficient. Results Data from a pilot animal (DM) and a misinjection (DMK) were excluded. No adverse events were observed. Six out of 10 evaluated items were selected for the sedation scale. Sedation scores were higher with DMK than DM (T10 to T60). The intraclass correlation coefficient &amp;gt; 0.81 for all raters indicates “very good” intra-rater (95% CI, 0.66 to 1) and inter-rater (95% CI, 0.71 to 1) reliability. Internal consistency was “excellent” (α = 0.904). Conclusions Deep sedation occurred with DMK but not DM. The sedation scale demonstrated validity, responsiveness, and reliability. Clinical Relevance The validated sedation scale aids consistency in evaluating sedation in bearded dragons.</div></details></td>
