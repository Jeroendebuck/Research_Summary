  - Journal: American Journal of Veterinary Research; Date: 2025-08-19
  - Cohort authors: Daniel Pang
  - 3 key points:
    - Aims and design: Randomized, blinded, crossover study to validate a sedation assessment scale in bearded dragons using two IM protocols (dexmedetomidine-methadone; and dexmedetomidine-methadone-ketamine).
    - Methods: 10 bearded dragons; sedation given IM; video-based assessment at baseline (T0) and every 5 minutes from 10 to 60 minutes; reversal with atipamezole (1 mg/kg) IM.
    - Conclusion: The study reports successful validation of the sedation assessment scale across both protocols for this species.

Methods In a randomized, blinded, crossover study, 10 bearded dragons were sedated IM with dexmedetomidine (0.1 mg/kg) and methadone (2 mg/kg; DM), and dexmedetomidine (0.1 mg/kg), methadone (2 mg/kg), and ketamine (10 mg/kg; DMK). Sedation assessment was performed with video recording at baseline (T0) and every 5 minutes from 10 to 60 minutes after injection (T10 to T60). After T60, atipamezole (1 mg/kg) was given IM. Behaviors used to assess sedation in several species were tested. Construct validity (ie, does a scale measure what is intended) was evaluated by comparing sedation scores over time using the Friedman and Dunn post hoc tests and between treatments, using a Mann-Whitney test. Scores of 25 videos randomly selected from a total of 216 recorded videos were used to calculate intra- and inter-rater reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Internal consistency was calculated using the Cronbach α coefficient. Results Data from a pilot animal (DM) and a misinjection (DMK) were excluded. No adverse events were observed. Six out of 10 evaluated items were selected for the sedation scale. Sedation scores were higher with DMK than DM (T10 to T60). The intraclass correlation coefficient &amp;gt; 0.81 for all raters indicates “very good” intra-rater (95% CI, 0.66 to 1) and inter-rater (95% CI, 0.71 to 1) reliability. Internal consistency was “excellent” (α = 0.904). Conclusions Deep sedation occurred with DMK but not DM. The sedation scale demonstrated validity, responsiveness, and reliability. Clinical Relevance The validated sedation scale aids consistency in evaluating sedation in bearded dragons.</div></details></td>
