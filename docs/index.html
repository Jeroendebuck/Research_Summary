          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">To understand diseases of wild urban jackrabbits (Lepus townsendii), we autopsied 130 individuals that died near roadways in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Renal hamartomas were present in 8 of 130 hares (6.2%; 95% confidence interval: 3.2%-11.7%). Most were unilateral (7/8); one case had bilateral lesions. Hamartomas are benign, tumor-like lesions comprised of normal tissue elements in abnormal amounts and arrangements. Macroscopically, hamartomas were white, tan, or pink-red, well-circumscribed, singular or multilobular, expansile nodules in the cortex or corticomedullary junction. Histologically, renal hamartomas consisted of well-demarcated mature stromal tissue with fibrous tissue and occasionally, adipocyte differentiation. These results represent a unique temporal and geographical cluster of a renal anomaly in an urban wildlife population. Renal hamartomas were not identified in other large studies of diseases in free-ranging leporids including hares. Contributing factors to this cluster remain unknown.</div></details></td>

Here we report on investigations of this mass mortality event and tie the “Arctic clone” of the bacterium &lt;italic&gt;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&lt;/italic&gt; (&lt;italic&gt;Er&lt;/italic&gt;) to the observed mortalities, making this the third reported independent mass mortality event in muskoxen associated with this bacterial strain. Between 2021 and 2024, we collected and analyzed samples from 139 unique muskox carcass sites using gross and microscopic pathology, bacterial culture, and molecular methods. &lt;italic&gt;Er&lt;/italic&gt; Arctic clone was found in association with &amp;gt; 70% of sampled carcasses. Our results underscore the geographic expanse over which this unique clonal lineage of &lt;italic&gt;Er&lt;/italic&gt; has now spread, its apparently high virulence in muskoxen, and its ongoing importance as a consideration in conservation and monitoring efforts related to this species.</div></details></td>

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Many ant species show dramatic shifts in behaviour when infected with parasites, but the molecular basis of these behavioural changes is not well understood. An example is the wood ant, Formica aserva, which serves as an intermediate host for the lancet liver fluke, Dicrocoelium dendriticum. Infected ants leave their nests during the cool hours of the day, ascend a flower and then attach themselves to a petal with their mandibles. Attached ants remain affixed to an inflorescence overnight, after which they detach, descend the plant and return to their nest. Unless eaten by a grazing mammal (the obligate next host), infected ants repeat this attach-and-detach cycle for the rest of the summer. We used transcriptomics to decipher the potential molecular mechanisms that underlie this reversible behaviour manipulation. Using naturally infected ants, we recreated the manipulation cycle in the laboratory and then evaluated messenger RNA from ant brains at four contrasting phases of manipulation. Among these phases, we found a total of 1349 transcripts differentially expressed between infected and uninfected ant brains. Many of these transcripts are involved in cell signalling pathways, including odorant, gustatory, vision, circadian rhythm and the production of biogenic monoamines and hormones. Metabolism, protein management and DNA repair functions might also play a role at different phases of manipulation. Our combined results are consistent with the idea that the mechanism(s) leading to the attach/detach/repeat sequence of behaviours of fluke-infected ants is multifaceted, involving much more than temperature-dependent contraction/relaxation of the mandibular muscles.</div></details></td>
